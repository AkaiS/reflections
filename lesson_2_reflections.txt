What happens when you initalize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

What happens is that the file is recognized as a git repository causing all the files inside to be recognized by git programs. This is necessary to be able to use git in the first place, no repository, no git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a workbench. You can use it to figure out what you are putting in your repository from your working directory but it won't be used for long term storage or controlling versions.
